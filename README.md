# Crypto Price Tracker and Descentralized Exchange

## Overview

Crypto price tracker built on React. A list of the top 50 cryptocurrencies, ranked by market cap, is displayed. A wallet containing a bag of USDC is provided, which can be used to buy other cryptocurrencies in the "swap" section, which simulates a descentralized exchange.

Crypto data was fetched from the [coinstats public API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/5734027/RzZ6Hzr3?version=latest).
